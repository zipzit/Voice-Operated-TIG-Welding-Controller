# Voice-Operated-TIG-Welding-Controller
Use an Alexa/Siri style voice system to control your TIG welder.  Designed for handicapped welders without access to foot pedal controller.  The intent here is to create a complete package so that anybody who wanted to build their own would have a complete guide to hardware and software.

The system is based on a Raspberry PI / Amazon Echo / Alexa controller system.

Voice Commands:

  - "Start arc", "start welding"
  - "increase current", "more current", "more juice", 'increase current to XXX amps"
  - "hold current" , "hold amperage",
  - "decrease current", "less current", "less juice"
  - "hold amperage"
  - "Stop arc", "stop welding"

  The system would give verbal feedback to all commands, including current amperage numbers.

Parts List:

   - Raspberry Pi / Orange Pi
   - On/Off toggle switch
   - Power supply
   - Connector compatible with your welder.
